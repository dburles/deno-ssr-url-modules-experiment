// todo
- universal router (waiting on https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/1789)
- server rendered async data loading ✔
- serve assets ✔

// maybe
- add a graphql client
- make app do something interesting

- we're going back to the old days with a controller per route
  all server rendered data is fetched at that point.
  it's possible to also fetch data purely on the client if it
  makes sense to do so. It may be handled within the client side _handler.

// later
- eslint/prettier
- deno environment variables?
- minification

// missing pieces
- !!! react cannot be imported via url as a module
- react does not properly support server side rendering, (waiting for suspense).

// notes
conventions:
  my_view.js (universal)
  my_view_handlers.js ← optional (client only) for attaching DOM event handlers and any other client only state updates.
  my_view_data.js ← optional (universal) for async data fetching.
