// todo
- universal router (waiting on https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/1789)
- server rendered async data loading ✔
- serve assets ✔
- add a graphql client
- make app do something interesting

- we're going back to the old days with a controller per route
  all server rendered data is fetched at that point.
  it's possible to also fetch data purely on the client if it
  makes sense to do so. It may be handled within the client side _handler.

// later
- server rendered lit-html
- eslint/prettier
- deno environment variables?
- minification

// missing pieces
- !!! react does not work when importing via url as a module
- react does not properly support server side rendering

// notes

conventions:
  my_component.js (universal)
  my_component_handlers.js ← optional (client only) for attaching DOM event handlers.
  my_component_data.js ← optional (universal) for async data fetching.
